modified from [passport-local](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-local).\n\n## Installation\n    $ npm install passport-token\n\n## Usage\n\nThe token authentication strategy authenticates users using a username and token. The strategy requires a verify callback, which accepts these credentials and calls done providing a user.\n\n    var TokenStrategy = require('passport-token').Strategy;\n    \n    passport.use(new TokenStrategy(\n    \tfunction (username, token, done) {\n    \t\tUser.findOne({username: username}, function (err, user) {\n    \t\t\tif (err) {\n    \t\t\t\treturn done(err);\n    \t\t\t}\n    \t\t\t\n    \t\t\tif (!user) {\n    \t\t\t\treturn done(null, false);\n    \t\t\t}\n    \t\t\t\n    \t\t\tif (!user.verifyToken(token)) {\n    \t\t\t\treturn done(null, false);\n    \t\t\t}\n    \t\t\t\n    \t\t\treturn done(null, user);\n    \t\t});\n    \t}\n    ));\n\nBy default, passport-token checks for `username` and `token` credentials in either the header or request body in these locations:\n\n### Headers\n\t\n    x-username\n    x-token\n    \n### Body fields\n\n    username\n    token\n\n### Configure\n\nThese credential locations can be configured when defining the strategy as follows:\n\n    var TokenStrategy   = require('passport-token').Strategy;\n    var strategyOptions = {\n        usernameHeader: 'x-custom-username',\n        tokenHeader:    'x-custom-token',        \n        usernameField:  'custom-username',\n        tokenField:     'custom-token'\n    };\n    \n    passport.use(new TokenStrategy(strategyOptions,\n    \tfunction (username, token, done) {\n    \t\tUser.findOne({username: username}, function (err, user) {\n    \t\t\tif (err) {\n    \t\t\t\treturn done(err);\n    \t\t\t}\n    \t\t\t\n    \t\t\tif (!user) {\n    \t\t\t\treturn done(null, false);\n    \t\t\t}\n    \t\t\t\n    \t\t\tif (!user.verifyToken(token)) {\n    \t\t\t\treturn done(null, false);\n    \t\t\t}\n    \t\t\t\n    \t\t\treturn done(null, user);\n    \t\t});\n    \t}\n   \n\n## Authenticate\n\nUse `passport.authenticate()`, specifying the `token` strategy to authenticate requests.\n\nFor example, as route middleware in an [Express](http://expressjs.com/) application:\n\n    app.put('/animals/dogs', passport.authenticate('token'), function (req, res) {\n    \t// User authenticated and can be found in req.user\n    });\n\nIf authentication fails in the above example then a 401 response will be given. However there may be times you wish a bit more control and delegate the failure to your application:\n\n    app.put('/animals/dogs', authenticate, function (req, res) {\n    \t   // User authenticated and can be found in req.user\n    });\n    \n    function authenticate(req, res, next) {\n        passport.authenticate('token', function (err, user, info) {\n            if (err) {\n                return next(err);\n            }\n            \n            if (!user) {\n                return res.status(401).json({message: \"Incorrect token credentials\"});\n            }\n           \n            req.user = user;\n            next();\n        });\n    }      \n\n## Credits\n[Jared Hanson](http://github.com/jaredhanson)\n\n## License\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 Jared Hanson\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
